# Dataset Detection on File Systems
{% subtitle %}
Rules and algorithms used by the Zeenea File System connector to identify datasets
{% /subtitle %}

---

## Introduction
{% callout type="info" %}
This document explains **how Zeenea detects datasets** when scanning file-system–based sources.
{% /callout %}

The Zeenea **File System–type connector** analyzes all objects starting from a configured **root path** and determines whether each object qualifies as a **dataset**.

{% steps %}
1. The algorithm traverses folders and files from the root path.
2. Each folder is evaluated against a defined set of rules.
3. Once a folder is identified as a dataset, **its analysis stops**.
4. The algorithm then proceeds to the **next sibling folder**.

## Folder Containing Only Files

### Rule 1 — Folder with only files
{% callout type="success" title="Dataset Identified" %}
A folder is considered a **dataset** if:
- It contains **only files**
- **At least one file** has a supported extension
{% /callout %}

#### Supported file extensions

`csv` · `parquet` · `orc` · `xml` · `json` · `avro`

{% table %}
* Example A
* Example B
---
* ![](/images/zeenea-folders-rule1a.png)
* ![](/images/zeenea-folders-rule1b.png)
---
* **Client** folder is a dataset (Rule 1)
* **Project** folder is a dataset (Rule 1)
---
* Contains only files
* Contains only files
---
* At least one supported extension
* At least one supported extension
---
* Schema extracted from most recent file (`Client20190827.csv`)
* Schema extracted from most recent file
---
* —
* If files are not homogeneous, schema may change on re-analysis
{% /table %}

## Folder with Subfolders

### Rule 2 — Folder containing non-partition subfolders
{% callout type="warning" title="Not a Dataset" %}
If a folder contains **any subfolder** whose name **does not follow partition naming conventions**, then:
- The parent folder **is not a dataset**
{% /callout %}

---

### Rule 3 — File-level datasets inside folders
{% callout type="info" title="File Can Be a Dataset" %}
A **file** can be detected as a dataset even if:
- It resides inside a folder containing subfolders  
- The file has a **supported extension**
{% /callout %}

{% table %}
* Example A
* Example B
---
* ![](/images/zeenea-folders-rule3a.png)
* ![](/images/zeenea-folders-rule3b.png)
---
* **Client** folder is **not** a dataset (Rule 2)
* **Client** folder is **not** a dataset (Rule 2)
---
* Contains subfolders `PP` and `PM`
* Contains subfolder `PP`
---
* Subfolders do not follow partition naming conventions
* Subfolder does not follow partition naming conventions
---
* `PP` and `PM` folders are datasets (Rule 1)
* `PP` folder is a dataset (Rule 1)
---
* —
* Files `Client20190225.csv` and `Client20190226.csv` are datasets (Rule 3)
{% /table %}

## Folder with Partitions

### Rule 4 — Folder containing only partitioned subfolders
{% callout type="success" title="Partitioned Dataset Detected" %}
A folder is considered a **dataset** when **both conditions** are met:
{% /callout %}

{% checklist %}
- All subfolder names follow the **partition naming convention**
- At least one subfolder **would itself be a dataset** if isolated
{% /checklist %}

{% table %}
* Valid Partition Example
* Mixed Subfolder Example
---
* ![](/images/zeenea-folders-rule4a.png)
* ![](/images/zeenea-folders-rule4b.png)
---
* **Client** folder is a dataset (Rule 4)
* **Client** folder is not a dataset (Rule 2)
---
* Subfolders `2019` and `2018` follow partition convention
* Subfolders `PP` and `2019` do not both follow partition convention
---
* `2019` would be a dataset if isolated
* `2019` is a dataset (Rule 4)
---
* `2019` contains subfolders `05` and `08`
* `PP` is a dataset (Rule 1)
---
* `08` contains only files with supported extensions

## Partition Naming Convention

{% callout type="note" title="How Zeenea Detects Partitions" %}
Subfolders are recognized as **partitions** if their names match **any** of the following regular expressions:
{% /callout %}

```regex
(.*=.*)
[0-9]{8}
[0-9]{4}
[0-9]{2}
0?[1-9]|1[012]
0?[1-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-9]|3[0-1]
